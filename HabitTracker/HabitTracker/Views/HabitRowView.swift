/* Reason : This happens because of how SwiftUI handles state updates with Core Data objects in separate subviews. Here‚Äôs what‚Äôs going wrong and how to fix it.
 
 üîπ Why Is the UI Updating Only in HabitListView?
 1Ô∏è‚É£ SwiftUI Only Tracks Direct State Changes in a View
 In HabitListView, @FetchRequest is directly observing the habit objects.

 When you modify habit.streak, SwiftUI recognizes the change because it's happening inside the same view that owns the @FetchRequest.

 2Ô∏è‚É£ When Using HabitRowView, SwiftUI Doesn't Know the Object Changed
 Core Data's NSManagedObject doesn't trigger SwiftUI updates automatically when modified inside a subview.

 HabitRowView only receives a reference to habit, but SwiftUI doesn‚Äôt track changes inside that reference.*/




/* Why Binding won't work
 
 There's a problem with .constant(habit) when used with @Binding<Habit>.

 üö® What's Wrong?
 swift
 Copy
 Edit
 HabitRowView(habit: .constant(habit))
 .constant(habit) creates a static, immutable binding to habit.

 But habit is a reference type (NSManagedObject), and @Binding expects a struct or value type.

 Core Data objects (NSManagedObject) don't work well with @Binding!

/*
 
 ‚úÖ Fix: Use @ObservedObject Instead of @Binding
 Since Habit is an NSManagedObject, it already conforms to ObservableObject internally.
 This means SwiftUI can track its changes only if we use @ObservedObject in the subview.
